  description: >-
    Teaching Kids to code is no longer novel, parents have
    discovered the benefits and are already taking actions. The pros out weighs the cons, not only do they acquire a great skill that is very relevant in our modern society
    today and the future, they also become better in other of their subjects as studies have shown, it is expected because coding equips you with soft skills like perseverance in the face of difficult situations. Ultimately they become better learners as they improve in their problem solving skill. Our kids code club gives kids the opportunity to learn programming through fun and interesting lessons in school at home through our private mentoring programme. They learn by building things that appeal to them like games, and fun apps which they get to enjoy with their friends, and also show to their parents, while also acquiring an indept knowledge of fundamental programming concepts and technologies. They also get involved in competitions both internally and externally with their counterparts from other schools, thereby giving them exposure. We have our   grading system, and at the end of each term, results would be issued based on performance. We've designed written, presentational, and pactical tests aimed at solidifying what has been learnt. Students will be working with modern technologies that are relevant in the tech world like scratch and python.
